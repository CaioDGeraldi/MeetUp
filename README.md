# MeetUp

> A dedicated platform for real-world gatherings in safe, certified, and structured environments.

## The Concept

MeetUp is not just an event app; it is a **trust infrastructure for social interaction**. We connect verified digital communities with trusted physical partner establishments, ensuring a qualified flow, legal security, and physical safety for all participants.

Our platform acts as a **flow guide**. The app facilitates connection and validation, while the partner establishment assumes responsibility for the physical security and local permits.

## How It Works

1.  **Biometric Registration:** Security from the start. Every user undergoes rigorous biometric validation to prevent fake profiles.
2.  **Partner Venues:** We suggest validated venues, ensuring they meet technical and legal capacity requirements.
3.  **Voucher System (QR Code):** Each participant generates a QR Code. This serves as a ticket, ensures venue capacity management, and facilitates check-in by the designated "Host."

## Safety and Legal Foundation

Our project is built on three main pillars to mitigate risks and ensure order:

* **Identity and Reliability:** KYC (*Know Your Customer*) protocols with selfie and document verification, combined with the positive history of hosts.
* **Shared Responsibility:** Clear exclusion clauses stating that the App acts as an intermediary, while the establishment is responsible for physical safety.
* **Immediate Safety:** Integrated panic button for real-time reporting during the gathering.

## Monetization Model

The business model is based on **Partnership Fees**. Establishments pay to become "Official Venues" on the platform, receiving qualified and safe community traffic.
